# CSGO-Spray

Counter Strike Global Offensive is listed among the top first person shooter games, it is extremely important to know how to aim in the game to reach a good level.  So here is where this app comes into place, spray patterns are exist for  each gun, also known as recoil, so once you fire bullets will scatter. 

What does this app offer ?

The app displays a spray pattern and an anti pattern, users should focus on learning the anti pattern. Users that use a left hand(In-game) are given a pattern too. 

The purpose of the development is to allow users to display the patterns while in game, it can seem difficult to ALT-Tab while in game to display them. Yes workshops do exist however for only the common guns.
